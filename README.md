Control two lightbulbs via a web interface

This is an automated light and heating control for a turtle tank.

Turles living indoors usually require some sort of artificial lighting and heating. There exists a variety of suitable devices on the market.
The one I had consisted of two lightbulbs, one for heating, the other for lighting. Each had dedicated manual switch. 
I have decided to make the switching automated, instead of having to manually press the switch every morning and evening.
